# Store automation

A tag on `master` becomes GitHub release assets immediately, and a scheduled
retry loop publishes each store as soon as its review queue allows. Human steps
are limited to what platforms require: account creation, credential issuance
and the first product submission.

## Model

```
git tag v3.1.0
   │
   ▼
release.yml ──▶ GitHub Release assets (source of truth, always green)
   │
   ▼
store-retry.yml (every 6h) ──▶ store-publish.yml
                                  ├─ cws  : upload → publish → readback → state ✓
                                  ├─ edge : upload → poll → publish → state ✓
                                  └─ amo  : wdzeng/firefox-addon → state ✓
```

- **Live listings (checked 2026-10-02):** Chrome Web Store only. There is no AMO listing (the AMO API returns 404 for the slug) and no Edge listing, so the amo and edge jobs have nothing to publish to until the one-time bootstrap runs; public copy says Firefox is a zip on each GitHub release.
- **`store-state` branch** (`state.json`) records the release tag accepted by
  each store submission API, not proof of the live public version. Review may
  still be pending. State advances only after the existing publish API/action
  succeeds and the state commit (when changed) and push succeed. A commit
  failure stops recording; only a clean staged diff permits skipping a commit.
- **Both manual CWS entrypoints use the same publisher.**
  `publish-cws.yml` delegates to `store-publish.yml` with `stores: cws`, passing
  its optional tag unchanged. Blank tags resolve the latest GitHub release;
  explicit tags build that tag, with tag/package-version verification. They
  share the retry loop's concurrency group and review-queue handling.
- **Review queues are expected.** `ITEM_NOT_UPDATABLE` (CWS),
  `InProgressSubmission` / `NoModulesUpdated` (Edge) exit 0 with a notice
  and retry next cycle. Real failures (auth, validation) exit 1 and never
  advance state.
- **One concurrency group** (`store-publish`) prevents overlapping runs
  from racing the state branch.

## Automated versus one-time human

| Step | Who | When |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub release from tag | agent | every tag |
| CWS package publish | agent | retry loop; blocked while item is in review unless a manual dispatch sets `cancel_pending` |
| CWS listing text | agent (API) / dashboard fallback | re-dispatch `update-cws-listing.yml` |
| Edge package publish | agent | after one-time bootstrap |
| AMO version publish | agent | after one-time bootstrap |
| Greasy Fork | **human, once** | no public API; script updates itself afterwards |
| Content posts (HN/Reddit/dev.to/PH) | human (or explicit opt-in) | drafts in `storefront/posts/`; auto-posting from fresh accounts is a ban risk, not automation |

## Agent-native execution model (three tiers)

Everything the project can ever need is in one of three tiers. Tier 1 is
the goal; Tier 2 is how the agent works where platforms have no API;
Tier 3 is identity, which no agent should ever hold.

| Tier | Mechanism | Who drives | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. API-native** | REST API from CI; secrets in repo | agent, fully unattended | CWS publish, Edge publish, AMO create+publish, listing metadata |
| **2. Browser handoff** | agent drives the USER's already-logged-in Chrome via CDP on 127.0.0.1 | agent operates, user holds identity | Greasy Fork upload, CWS dashboard fallback, real screenshots, Edge product creation |
| **3. Human identity** | account creation / email+phone verification / CAPTCHA | human, once | AMO account, Microsoft developer account, CWS developer account, Greasy Fork account |

Browser handoff is **not** robot automation: no passwords, cookies, or
sessions ever leave the user's machine, and no CAPTCHA is ever bypassed.
The user logs in once; the agent then does the work in that session.

Start Chrome with a local-only debug port (quit Chrome first):
- macOS: `open -a "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222`
- Linux: `google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`
- Windows: `chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222`

Then run the handoff scripts: `node scripts/greasy-fork-upload.mjs`,
`node scripts/cws-listing.mjs`, `node scripts/cws-screenshots.mjs`,
`node scripts/edge-bootstrap.mjs <open|upload-zip|fill-listing|submit>`.
Every script fails loudly and prints the live page text on selector
drift — the agent adapts, never fakes.

## Secrets

| Store | Repo secrets |
|---|---|
| Chrome Web Store (API v2, service account, preferred) | `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID`, `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID` |
| Chrome Web Store (API v2, OAuth refresh token) | `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID`, `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`, `CHROME_CLIENT_ID`, `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN` ([setup](CHROME_WEB_STORE_SETUP.md)) |

`CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` is not a secret (CWS dashboard, Account page). Set it as the
`CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` repo **variable**; a secret of the same name also works and
wins. The Chrome Web Store API v1.1 shuts down on 2026-10-15, so there is no
publisher-less path any more: with credentials but no publisher id the CWS job
fails with a message naming the variable.
| Microsoft Edge Add-ons | `EDGE_CLIENT_ID`, `EDGE_API_KEY`, `EDGE_PRODUCT_ID` |
| Firefox AMO | `FIREFOX_JWT_ISSUER`, `FIREFOX_JWT_SECRET` |

Passwords for Google, Microsoft and Mozilla accounts never enter the repo or an
agent; identity stays with the account holder.

## One-time bootstrap

### Chrome Web Store

Two auth paths share one workflow (`store-publish.yml`) and both call the CWS
API v2 through `scripts/cws-v2.mjs`. When `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` is set the
service-account path is used; otherwise an access token is minted from the
`CHROME_*` OAuth refresh-token secrets (same v2 calls). Either path without
`CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` or `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID` fails the run rather than silently
falling back.

**Service account setup (once, no human clicks afterwards)**

1. In the Sylphx GCP project (owned by the company Google account
   `agent@sylphx.com`), enable the **Chrome Web Store API**.
2. Use the shared service account `cws-publisher` (one per publisher; the CWS
   dashboard accepts only one). It needs no IAM roles. Create a JSON key for it.
3. In the CWS Developer Dashboard, **Account**, set the **Service account**
   field to the `cws-publisher` email. The dashboard owner does this once.
4. Add repo secrets: `CWS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` (the whole key file),
   `CWS_PUBLISHER_ID` (the publisher id from the dashboard), and
   `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID` (already set).

`scripts/cws-v2.mjs` signs a JWT with `node:crypto`, exchanges it for an access
token (scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/chromewebstore`), and calls the
v2 endpoints on `https://chromewebstore.googleapis.com`: `fetchStatus`,
`:upload`, `:publish`, `:cancelSubmission` (full list in the script header).
The key and token are never printed (the token is masked). After publish it
reads the item back with `fetchStatus` and fails (no state advance) unless the
submission shows as `PENDING_REVIEW`, `STAGED`, `PUBLISHED` or
`PUBLISHED_TO_TESTERS`; the state and version go to the run log and step
summary. Auth, upload, publish and readback errors exit 1.

**Pending reviews and `cancel_pending`**

While a version is in review the item cannot take an upload. Without
`cancel_pending` the run exits 0 with a notice and the retry loop tries again
(v2 has no documented error code for this, so the script reads `fetchStatus`
first; `ITEM_NOT_UPDATABLE` is only a fallback match on a failed upload).
To cancel the pending submission, upload and publish in one run, dispatch the
manual entrypoint with the switch:

```bash
gh workflow run "Publish to Chrome Web Store (manual)" -f tag=<tag> -f cancel_pending=true
```

`cancel_pending` is off by default, exists only on that manual dispatch, and is
never passed by the scheduled retry or `publish-stores.yml`. It works on both
auth paths (v2 has `:cancelSubmission`). v2 documents no
call to withdraw a `STAGED` (approved, unpublished) submission other than
`:publish`.

### Microsoft Edge Add-ons (~30 min, once)

1. [Register as an Edge extension developer](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge/overview) (developer account).
2. Create the product once in Partner Center: upload
   `google-photos-delete-tool.zip`, fill listing copy from
   `storefront/listing.json` (`edge` section), privacy/availability.
   This first submission goes through certification manually.
3. In Partner Center → **Publish API** → **Enable** (new experience) →
   **Create API credentials**. Copy the Client ID and the API key.
4. Copy the **Product ID** (GUID from the extension overview URL).
   Steps 2–4 can be driven by the agent through browser handoff
   (`node scripts/edge-bootstrap.mjs open|upload-zip|fill-listing|submit`);
   Partner Center has no product-creation API, so this is Tier 2 once.
5. Add repo secrets:
   - `EDGE_CLIENT_ID` — the Client ID from step 3
   - `EDGE_API_KEY` — the API key from step 3 (note the expiry date)
   - `EDGE_PRODUCT_ID` — the product GUID from step 4
6. Dispatch: `gh workflow run "Publish Stores (manual)" -f stores=edge -f tag=<tag>`
   — from then on the retry loop publishes every tag automatically.

Edge API contract (v1.1):
base `https://api.addons.microsoftedge.microsoft.com/v1`; headers
`Authorization: ApiKey $EDGE_API_KEY` + `X-ClientID: $EDGE_CLIENT_ID`.
No API exists for creating a product or updating listing metadata —
Partner Center only.

### Firefox AMO (~10 min, once — API-native, no browser)

1. Create an [AMO developer account](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/)
   (Tier 3) and generate API credentials at
   `https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/`
   (JWT issuer + secret).
2. Add repo secrets: `FIREFOX_JWT_ISSUER` + `FIREFOX_JWT_SECRET`.
3. Dispatch **once**: `gh workflow run "Bootstrap AMO Add-on (manual, once)"`
   — this creates the add-on and submits the first listed version through
   AMO API v5 (upload → validation → create → description → verify),
   using listing copy from `storefront/listing.json`. No browser, no dev
   hub. Screenshots/icon are the only AMO listing fields the API cannot
   set (Mozilla limitation) — add them once in the dev hub, or via
   browser handoff.
4. From then on every tag is submitted automatically by the retry loop.

### Greasy Fork (20 min, once — no API exists)

Greasy Fork has no public API. After the user creates an account and
logs in once (Tier 3), the agent uploads the script through browser
handoff: `node scripts/greasy-fork-upload.mjs` (form contract verified
from Greasy Fork's own source: `/en/script_versions/new`, fields
`code_upload` / `name` / `description`). The script header carries
`@version` + `@updateURL`/`@downloadURL` pointing at GitHub releases, so
**Greasy Fork users auto-update on every release** — this one upload is
the entire lifetime cost.

### CWS listing text

`storefront/listing.json` is the single source. Push it with:

```bash
gh workflow run "Update CWS Listing (manual)"
```

It fails while the item is in review (`ITEM_NOT_UPDATABLE` on upload, HTTP 304
on metadata); re-dispatch after review clears. If the metadata endpoints are
unavailable, the browser-handoff fallback pastes the same file into the
dashboard: `node scripts/cws-listing.mjs --item-id <id>`.
Screenshots: `node scripts/cws-screenshots.mjs` captures real 1280×800
shots from the user's own Google Photos session (dry-run + filters are
safe; running/empty-trash require `--allow-destructive` and the user
watching). Edge/AMO listing metadata is Partner-Center/AMO-dashboard only
by design.

## Runbook

```bash
# publish a specific tag to a specific store right now
gh workflow run "Publish Stores (manual)" -f stores=cws -f tag=<tag>

# publish whatever is pending to all stores (same engine as the retry)
gh workflow run "Publish Stores (manual)" -f stores=auto

# run the retry loop once now
gh workflow run "Store Publish Retry (scheduled)"

# check recorded submissions (not live-version proof)
git fetch origin store-state && git show origin/store-state:state.json
```

## Evidence per layer

| Layer | Proof |
|---|---|
| Source | `storefront/listing.json` validated by `bun run listing:check` (CI) |
| CI | workflows parse (YAML), listing limits enforced, builds+verify green |
| Deploy | workflow runs: upload/publish steps, operation IDs, status JSON |
| Submitted | `store-state` branch (`state.json` per store); review may still be pending |
| Live | Independent store page/version readback after review; unknown without that evidence |

A green workflow run or `store-state` record alone is **not** live-version
proof. Without independent store-page/version readback, the public version
remains unknown. The workflow prints operation IDs and status bodies
so every claim has a platform-side locator.
